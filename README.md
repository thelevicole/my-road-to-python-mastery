# My road to Python mastery

A dumping ground for my progress learning Python. Most of these will be written in Python 3.7

### Basic usage
Python 3 upwards is required, download and install from the official website [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Running via terminal:
```bash
$ python3 {filename}.py
```
